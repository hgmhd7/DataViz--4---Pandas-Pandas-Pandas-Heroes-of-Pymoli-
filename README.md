# Data munging a sample dataset called the Heroes of Pymoli.  This data is a creative representation of a Dungeons and Dragons type game in which I wanted to explore and learn more about.  In this project, I extract and synthesize information from the data to gain insights on player counts, gender demographics, in game purchasing analysis, age demographics, spending patterns, and profitablilty demographics.
